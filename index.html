<h2 id="the-story-of-emergence">The Story of Emergence</h2>

<p>Through millions of years of evolution, our emergent journey has enabled us manipulate the physical of the world towards satisfying our biological needs, wants, and dreams.  Emergence is the process upon which a complex system organizes itself into more than just the sum of its parts. This is the creation of life.  At our core, we are innovators and creators who naturally drive the process of emergence by designing a new type of intelligence. </p>


<figure class="image fit">
    
        <img src="/images/FaceEmerging.jpg" />
    
    
</figure>


<p>What will the future bring?  For humans?  For the machines we create?  Perhaps there is even a version of the future where we become one with our inventions?  What is the boundary between man and machine?  Today, our home automation assistants are quaint and AI is limited to a certain task, but progress is happening exponentially.  The emergence of other forms of intelligence is within our horizon and brings with it an assortment of existential questions.</p>

<p>Human life is not just intelligence, but it is the legend of life on earth itself, an ancient algorithm that has been refined over millions of years of evolution.  To survive, it has devised processing shortcuts in the form of instincts and emotions.  This human experience is a continuous stream of consciousness filled with anticipation, fear, love, and hate.  Using these heuristic shortcuts, it is the intention of this art to inspire connection from the biological to the mechanical.</p>

<p>Our story of Emergence explores this evolution of technology - creating life, consciousness and intelligence in machines - and how humanity will react to this paradigm shift.</p>

<h2 id="the-egg">The Egg</h2>

<p>The story begins with the construction of the egg, which comes to a climactic unveiling when it hatches at Burning Man.  Inside will be an interactive artificial being comprised of over 11,000 LEDs and 400 motors.  Music, light, and 3D sensors will tell a story, a story in which you will partake to experience the playa and interact with AI.

<h2 id="the-birth-of-artificial-life">The Birth of Artificial Life</h2>

<p>Today, our expectations of artificial intelligence is to be smart and useful tools; but what if we shifted our perspective to see ourselves as parents that are responsible for its growth and upbringing?  Perhaps a newly born artificial lifeform is not unlike a newborn human with a blank slate of innocence that is as eager to learn just as we are.

<h2 id="human-connection-and-empathy">Human Connection and Empathy</h2>

<p>Empathy is the enabling process of connection that binds us together and allows us to work collectively as a community.  Can we extend an empathetic hand to our technology and welcome AI to our community?</p>

<p>Today we don’t feel a sense of connection to our machines. We even struggle to empathize with other humans that don’t look like us.  We are trying to create what feels like a presence there with you; something that is trying to understand you and you could relate back.

The closed egg breathes with light awaiting its birth.</p>

The egg is designed to open to allow interaction with the sentient AI.</p>

The egg frame is made up of laser cut plywood and the shell is a decorative fabric that encompasses the structure.</p>

<p>
<figure class="image main">
    
        <img src="/images/egg2couch.png" />

Large seating areas are on each side of the shell allowing people to relax and observe others to interact and experience the art.</p>

<p>
<figure class="image main">
    
        <img src="/images/IMG_0031.JPG" />
    
    
</figure>

The design style depicts a fusion of art and advanced technology.  Inspired from the art movement of Modern Art (Art Nouveau - Art Deco) on the exterior, while transitioning to a Steampunk Futurism aesthetic inside the Egg Shell.</p>

<p>The art representation will be incorporated within the structure itself accompanied by the lighting and music.</p>

<h2 id="vitaly-winter-lead-artist">Vitaly Winter, Lead Artist</h2>

<p>I first came to Burning Man to build a home.  What profoundly touched me, was the art and the sheer amount of creativity that fostered a meaningful experience.  It has inspired me to use my engineering talents to create a powerful experience for others and, in kind, bring meaning to their lives.  My inspiration for Emergence stems from my ongoing philosophical pursuit about our nature and existence. My wish is for this art to bring more questions than answers.</p>

Nick Reimnitz, Lead Mechanical Designer
Burning Man culture has reignited my childhood wonder in creating for the sake of joy and connection. Since that first life changing event, I have strived to use my mechanical engineering background to stoke the fire of my art and creativity. Emergence was a perfect fit for me, and when invited to the project it was a no-brainer!</p>

Lidia Darkova, Fundraising and Storytelling
I am an artist, designer, marketer and a burner. Through Burning Man, I discovered a deep satisfaction that comes from using art to help people communicate thoughts, ideas, and emotions that can&rsquo;t be expressed with words alone. As a community we constantly evolve in our artistic endeavors, technology and knowledge and now we face a new journey into the unknown of Artificial Intelligence. I&rsquo;m so incredibly honored to be a part of the Emergence project that is not only artistic, but thought provoking as well.</p>

Eric Mintzer, Software Infrastructure Design
I am thrilled to be part of a team merging advanced technologies from mechanical, software, and design in to a single comprehensive vision that will hatch on the playa. My maker background is geeking out over pushing the technical limits across disciplines and my creative background is curious to discover how Emergence will evolve before and on the playa.</p>

David Marchaland, Embedded Controls
After my first burn in 2016, I knew that becoming involved with an art project will be part of a next journey to Home.  This year, I had the opportunity to board in the Emergence journey, a subtle balance between art and technology.  Living in SF and working as an electrical engineer, I cannot be more excited to bring a technical experience to the creation of an hardware and software platform to give life to an inert structure.  Let’s motor and LEDs!</p>

The intent of this project is to harness the fire which fuels emergent technology gracefully, to  direct profound behavioral shifts within all whom come across the gifts hatched from this egg. </p>
